		The Santos Family Foundation was created to improve automotive safety, with a emphasis on decreasing vehicular fatalities.  This summer, a 4 student team was tasked to translate this goal into a Senior Capstone Project (SCOPE) at the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering.  The hope here is for the SCOPE team to not only have richly educationaly experience, but also that the product of their labor may spark greater action from drivers, the government and the auto industry, in a grassroots, bottom-up manner.
